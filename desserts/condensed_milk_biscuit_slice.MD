## Ingredients
### base
* 1 pack marie biscuits (blended till completely crushed)
* 100grams butter (melted)
* 1/2 can condensed milk
* 2 table spoons golden syrup 

### toping
* 1 block(200ish grams) dairy milk chocolate (melted)
* 50grams copha (melted)
* sultanas and/or nuts

## Method
1. Combine ingredients for base
2. press down into baking tray or dish lined with baking paper. should be about 1cm thick with depth remaining in the container for the top layer.
3. put in fridge while combining and melting ingredients for top.
4. remove from fridge and pour on top (add sultanas/nuts as desired)
5. put back in fridge for at least a few hours or till hard and then cut into smaller pieces.

Lasts about a week in the fridge but can be frozen too. I usually make a double batch as the condensed milk asks for a half can.
